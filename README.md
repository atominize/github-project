# Intro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and material-ui.

## Getting started

To build the project, first clone the repository.
`cd` into the folder and run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
After run `npm start`.

## Tools

I used VS-Code Editor, with the following extensions:

1. ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
2. Live Server
3. Prettier - Code formatter
